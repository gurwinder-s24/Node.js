- Added basic stateful authentication using uuid and cookies
- Added a simple login page, signup page

// Problem of Stateful Authentication
- It logout the user when the server restarts, 
    or we can say when we reload the page, because
    the sessionId on server-side is lost as it was stored in memory,
    and the sessionId stored in cookie on client-side is still there, 
    so it will not match with any sessionId on server-side, 
    and it will logout the user.
