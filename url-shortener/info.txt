// In this commit
- Replaced stateful auth with stateless auth using json web tokens (JWT)
- changed the way token is stored and sent in requests
    now user/frontend will receive a token in response and it is 
    user's responsibility to store it and send it in subsequent
    requests in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.
